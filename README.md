## ⚠️ Global Testing Safety Guidelines (Must Read First)

Before launching heavy synthetic stress benchmarks across any directory, always implement these safety measures:
1. **Never Benchmark on Battery:** Always connect your laptop to its AC wall charger before running benchmarks like FurMark or CrystalDiskMark to prevent power-throttling and inaccurate results.
2. **Track Live Temperatures:** Keep HWMonitor or CrystalDiskInfo open in the background. If any core component (CPU, GPU, or NVMe SSD) exceeds **90°C–95°C**, stop the test immediately to prevent thermal degradation.
3. **Save Work Before RAM Testing:** Built-in tools like `mdsched.exe` will force your operating system to reboot immediately. Always save your active files and close documents first.
4. **Epilepsy Warning:** Screen fixing tools like UDPixel22 flash colors rapidly. Avoid staring directly at the flashing patterns if you are sensitive to rapid visual flashes.

## 💡 Quick Anti-Scam Guide for Used Hardware Buyers

* **Hardware Spoofing:** Always match the specification string displayed in **CPU-Z** and **GPU-Z** against standard retail specs. Watch out for the "Fake" flag next to graphics card entries in GPU-Z.
* **Storage S.M.A.R.T Tampering:** Scammers can wipe disk hours to mask a dying drive. Always cross-verify the **Total Host Writes (GB)** against **Power-on Hours** inside CrystalDiskInfo; high writes with low hours mean the data has been cleared.
* **Ghost Typing:** Launch the peripheral tester and leave the keyboard untouched for 10 seconds. If random keys light up automatically on the layout, the keyboard has internal liquid or hardware damage.
